Suppliers-

  The suppliers will have an app, in which , contains data of medicines or medicinal accessories which are consumed on a periodical basis, and it tracks the number of such accessories consumers buy.The stock is tracked, on a basis of ,number of stock purchased, and when the stock of each customer goes below a certain level, the supplier gets a notification.
  For eg. A girl with periods buy 4 sets of pads usable for 4 months, it will definitely go out of stock after 4 months. So, such info is tracked from the supplier side.


Distributors-
  There will be a common vehicle to make the supply reach to all customers, and thus, the system provides cost effectiveness.
  


This idea is inspired from trying to think of the numerous problems portrayed in the tamil film 'Peranbu' ,and this is a small solution for one of them. <3
